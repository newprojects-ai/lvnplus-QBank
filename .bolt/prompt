For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Also take into consideration that the DB is MariaDB and NOT SUPABASE. Please don't waste any time or tokens coming up with SUPABASE ideas or implementations. All designs should be for a underlying MariaDB database
